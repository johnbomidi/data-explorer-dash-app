## Welcome to Data Explorer App Blog

Here are some great resources used to build this app!

### Dash Documentation

The dash documentation is quite thorough.  RTFM!

#### Upload

#### Dropdown
The tutorial has a good introduction to the dropdown components for selecting the index and columns to explore.

#### Basic and Advanced Callbacks
The upload and dropdown examples had some callback logic introduced already.  The tuturial helped further on chained callbacks to use output of the index to change the dropdown for available columns to plot.
